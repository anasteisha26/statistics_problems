# Repository of Statistical Problems
---
This repository contains different statistical or mathematical problems, which I was asked at the interviews or something I stumbled upin on the Internet.
The purpose of this repository is showing my skills, applying theoretical knowledge to solve real-world questions.
Each Jupyter Notebooks is a distinct task, containing its own explanations in Jupyter cells.
